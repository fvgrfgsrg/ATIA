# Axiomatic Theory of Infinitary Arithmetic (ATIA)
## A Framework for Dividing by Zero and Infinity

---

### Abstract

Dividing by zero and handling infinity have historically been undefined or problematic in classical mathematics. This paper introduces the Axiomatic Theory of Infinitary Arithmetic (ATIA), a rigorous mathematical framework that combines extended arithmetic with probability limits and classical analysis to define division by zero and infinite quantities consistently. ATIA opens new avenues in theoretical and applied mathematics by bridging algebra, analysis, and statistics.

### 1. Introduction

Classical mathematics treats division by zero as undefined and infinity as a concept rather than a number. This limitation restricts mathematical modeling in various scientific fields. We present ATIA, a new axiomatic system that extends the number system and uses probability limits to make sense of dividing by zero and manipulating infinity.

---

### 2. Motivation

In applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, expressions involving division by zero or infinity often arise but lack rigorous handling. ATIA provides a consistent and meaningful interpretation of these operations, enabling improved theoretical understanding and practical computation.

### 3. Core Axioms Formalized

#### Axiom 1: Zeta-Inversion

Define a new element `zeta^-1` such that it represents the "inverse of zero," i.e., `1 / 0 = zeta^-1`

For any `a in R \ {0}`:
- `a * zeta^-1 = zeta^-1`
- `0 * zeta^-1` = undefined or assigned special behavior (see Axiom 3)

#### Axiom 2: Omega Behavior

Define `omega` as an infinite element satisfying:
- For all `a in R+`, `a * omega = omega`
- For all `a in R \ {0}`, `omega / a = omega`
- Also: `omega + a = omega`, `omega + omega = omega`

#### Axiom 3: Indeterminate Collapse

For indeterminate forms (`0/0`, `omega/omega`), define a mapping:
- `X / Y -> omega_a` where `omega_a` represents a probabilistically derived or limit-convergent value depending on the nature of `X`, `Y`

#### Axiom 4: Hierarchical Infinities and Infinitesimals

Define ordered sets `{omega_i}` for i ∈ N where:
- `omega_i < omega_j` for `i < j`
- Define `epsilon_k = 1 / omega_k`
- `epsilon_k -> 0` as `k -> infinity`, maintaining a structured infinitesimal scale

### 4. Connecting ATIA to Classical Analysis via Limits

We reinterpret classical indeterminate forms using statistical and limit-theoretic constructs:
- `lim_{x -> 0} f(x)/g(x)` where both → 0 can map to `omega_a`
- `lim_{x -> ∞} h(x)/k(x)` where both → ∞ can also collapse to `omega_b`

These reinterpretations retain rigorous limit definitions while permitting structured manipulation of divergence and singularities.

### 5. Statistical Integration via Probability Limits

In ATIA, we define the Probability Limit (plim) as follows:

Let `(X_n)` be a sequence of functions or values involving singular behaviors.

Then:

- `plim_{n -> ∞} X_n = x` if `P(|X_n - x| > epsilon) -> 0` for all `epsilon > 0`

This is analogous to convergence in probability in statistics and allows us to assign values to limits like `1/0` in controlled probabilistic models.

---

### 6. Applied Framework

ATIA is designed for extensibility:
- Symbolic algebra systems can integrate `zeta^-1`, `omega`, and `epsilon_k`
- Probabilistic symbolic computation engines can collapse undefined limits to consistent generalized values
- Suitable for integration into differential equations, physics simulations, and information theory

### 7. Example Evaluations

- Example 1: `a = 5`, then `a * zeta^-1 = zeta^-1`
- Example 2: `0 * zeta^-1 = lim_{n -> ∞} a_n * (1 / b_n) = c`, if `(a_n)`, `(b_n) -> 0` and `a_n / b_n -> c`
- Example 3: `omega_2 < omega_5` if `2 < 5`; `epsilon_2 > epsilon_5`
- Example 4: `omega / omega = lim_{n -> ∞} a_n / b_n -> c or omega_a`
- Example 5: `omega * zeta^-1 = omega_a`

---

### 8. Summary

- Division by zero is modeled as `zeta^-1`
- Indeterminate forms are resolved via limit analysis
- Infinities and infinitesimals are structured in a meaningful hierarchy
- ATIA bridges classical analysis, statistics, and extended arithmetic

### 9. Future Directions

- Formal categorical model of ATIA
- Machine-learning integration for probabilistic singularities
- Applied models for physics (e.g., singularities in GR), computation (e.g., undefined behaviors), and finance (e.g., discontinuous pricing)
